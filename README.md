1 - Implementation of K-means.
2 - Classification of iris dataset with pure implementations of models like SVM, Passive-Aggressive and KNN.
3 - Pure implementation of a **Multi-Layer Perceptron**, then classifying the **MNIST** benchmark dataset.
4 - Implementation of a **Multi-Layer Perceptron** using **Pytorch** library, then classifying the **MNIST** benchmark dataset.
5 - Implementation of a **CNN** using **Pytorch** library, then classifying the **Fashion-MNIST** benchmark dataset.
